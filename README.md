# Hard Skills

There are a few examples of how I've applied basic DA skills:

- SQL
- Python ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
- Airflow
- A/B tests

# Projects

There are some projects that I've done as part of work, study, or pet projects.

### Delivery app A/B

The team implemented a smart product recommendation system in the app — it is assumed that such a system will help users work with the app more efficiently and find the necessary products better.

To check the effectiveness of the recommendation system, an AB-test was conducted.

My task is to evaluate whether the new recommendation system was able to benefit the business and the app users. To do this, select the metrics that are responsible for the quality of service and statistically compare these metrics in the two groups.

### E-learning A/B

Developers team changed the payment mechanics on the website. During the testing of one hypothesis, the target group was offered a new payment mechanics on the site, while the control group kept the basic mechanics. It is necessary to analyze the results of the experiment and conclude whether it is worth launching the new payment mechanics on all users.

### E-learning analysis

A number of questions answered in the analysis:

1. How many students successfully passed only one course?
2. Hardest and easiest exam: find the courses and exams within a course that have the lowest and highest completion rates.
3. For each course, determine the average time to complete the exams.
4. Identify the most popular subjects (TOP-3) by the number of registrations for them. And also the subjects with the highest churn rate (TOP-3).
5. Using pandas, between early 2013 and late 2014, identify the semester with the lowest course completions and the longest average course deadlines.
6. Using python, build adapted RFM clusters of students to qualitatively assess your audience.

### Macro data base

A project in which macroeconomic data from various sources (GDP, exchange rates, mining data, etc.) are collected and visualized using Tableau.

Now the project is in the process of transformation, the data will be added gradually.
The current structure includes:

- Automation with Airflow
- Data Scrapping and Processing with Python
- Data storage in Clickhouse
- Data visualisation in Tableau

### Competitor’s strategy analysis

The project allows analyzing the direction of development of competitive companies by news sources with the help of LLM

Now the project is in the process of transformation, the data will be added gradually.

### Palm oil forecast

The main idea of the project is to predict the cost of palm oil using neural networks.
